====================
MINECRAFT SUNDIAL
====================
By sunkid

https://github.com/sunkid/minecraft-sundial/

Provides a clock and sun/moon dial widget to show the current time and "date" on an SMP world.

On startup and occasionally afterwards, the widget retrieves the current number of clicks (the
'Time' value from level.dat) from the server. It calculates the "date" based on converted 
wall-clock seconds since the epoch, where a wall-clock second is 72 seconds on a minecraft world. 
Between updates from the server, the time, date, and dial are updated using the browser's clock.

Examples
____

`Static snapshot of a map generated with Minecraft-Overviewer with sundial widget <http://sunkid.github.com/minecraft-sundial>`_.

Installation
____________

#) download the distribution:

   https://github.com/sunkid/minecraft-sundial/raw/master/dist/sundial.zip

#) unzip all files in your map's HTML directory; this directory must also contain the nbt.class.php
   file listed above under requirements

#) edit your map's html file (e.g. index.html) and add the following

   1. Any HTML map:

      (1) in the <head> section (you can skip the first line if jQuery is already there)::

		<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.5.min.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="http://jqueryrotate.googlecode.com/files/jQueryRotate.1.7.js"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript" src="sundial.js"></script>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="sundial.css" type="text/css"/>

      (2) in the <body> section right after the <div> containing the map::

		<div id="mcdial" class="mcdial">
		<img src="mask.png" id="mask">
		<img src="dial.png" id="dial">
		<div id="date" class="datetime">DATE</div>
		<div id="time" class="datetime">TIME</div>
		<div id="debug" class="datetime" style="visibility: hidden;">&nbsp;</div>
		<div id="sdcredits" class="datetime">
			<a class="sdlink" href="https://github.com/sunkid/minecraft-sundial">minecraft sundial</a>
		</div>
		</div>
	
   2. Supported mapping tools:

      Check the util/ directory for supported tools and patches

#) edit getServerTime.php script to point to your world's level.dat file
#) test getServerTime.php by running::

	php getServerTime.php

   the output should look something like this::
